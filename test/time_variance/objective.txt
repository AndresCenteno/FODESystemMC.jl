#TODO
#SaveSamples should be enough

wanna do like 1e6 simulations, analyze time (and variance of time), variance of result by incrementing some values 
as in

1D: maybe start here
size of laplacian (so rate, diagonal value)
final time for a given simulation above in 1D
mean value of \alpha

dimension of laplacian considered

and like store mean variance (so online computation of variance??)
mean variance in d/d\alpha, d/du0 and d/dA
and times in an array
